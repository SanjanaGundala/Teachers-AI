Class Pet

Don’t you think room 2 should have a class pet? Well I do because A new person each weekend could take him home, it could be someones job every week to feed him, and we have opsions.

One reason I belive Room 2 should have a class pet is because we could take it home for the weekend. We could write about what we did with it and then show or writing to the class. 

Another reason I belive we should have a class pet is because it could be someones jobb to take care of it. Somebody might even want to be a vet when they grow up. Also we could learn alot. 

The final reason I beive we should have a class pet is because we don’t have to just. We have options. Likemost classes have fish we could have a lizard or a snake. My sister has a Guinea Pig and it is really cute. 

As you can see Room 2 really needs a class pet in all ways.
