Did you know that cats and dogs can actually be best friends? Even though they can be friends, I vote cats! I think that cats are reliable pets. Cats are reliable pets because they are very smart, they are easy to handle, and most of all, because they teach you responsibility.

One reason that cats are reliable pets is that they are very smart.
For example, a cat's memory is 200 times as long as a dogs!
Another example for this is that if you have an outdoor cat, it will look on both sides when it crosses the street.
Lastly, since they can't talk to you in human languagem they use body language such as their tails!

Another reason that cats are reliabler pets is that they are easy to handle.
For example, you don't need to do as much exercise for them like taking them on walks, or going outside to play with them.
Second of all, it is easier to plan a trip because they don't drink as much water, and they don't need to go outside to do anything physical, or go to the bathroom.
Lastly, cats are less active and need less taking care of.

Although cats are reliable pets because they are smart, or because they are easy to handle.
Cats are especially reliable pets because they teach you responsibility.
One example for this is that you have to feed them and look out for them.
Another example for this is that you have to play with them a few minutes a day.
Lastly, they teach you to be a good friend.

In conclusion, cats are reliable pets because they are very smart, they are easy to handle, and most of all, because they teach you responsibility.
I think that besides all of this, cats are the greatest pets!
