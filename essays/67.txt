Baseball

You like baseball? Well I do. Oh you don't know what it is surprise surprise. Then today I will be teaching about baseball. I will teach you about what is it, bases, and player/teams. So I hope you love my writing and learn a lot.

Fwoosh, "Strike three you're out" the catcher says with a despairing tone in his voice. Today I'll teach you about rules. One of the first most known rule is three strikes you're out. Another well known rule is if you hit the home plate after touching every other base you score a point. Another is you have to get the ball to the hot spot to get someone out if there not on a base. Or you can catch the ball right when they hit it no matter where they are.

Have you ever watched or played baseball? Well if you have then you may know the bases. The main base the one you hit at is called the home base. When you hit the first base you run to is pretty much what it is first base. The second one you run to is considered second base. The third one is third base. Then it's back to the dugout.

Teams are one of the most important parts of baseball. TOday I will teach you about the most known teams. Some of the most known teams include Dodgers, Giants, yankees, and red sox. There other teams like the cardinals too. There are also teams like the angeles, blue jays, rangers, astros, athletics, and rays wich aren't as popular but still really popular.

So I hoped you learned a lot about baseball. I talked about rules, bases, and teams. Baseball is fun i hope you try it and see you next time on my next book about civil war. So go out and play baseball.
