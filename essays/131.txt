Orca Whales

Have you ever heard of an Orca, AKA the “Killer Whale”? Killer Whales are huge, a whoping 3,000 lbs! Killer Whales and Orcas are amazing and I would like to prove it.

The Body Of The Beast

Orcas have a very cool body structure, that structure can be up to 23ft long! First off we have a Orcas tooth. An Orca tooth is very sharp, don’t touch it! On the other hand, the Orca has smooth skin, where as a sharks skin is like sandpaper! But we’re not talking about sharks though. A Orca has a blow hole to breath. It can hold its breath for hours.

Diet

A Orca is a apex-preadtor, which means it has no natral enimies. A Orca is also a carnivore which means it only eats meat for example, fish, penguins, young whales, seals, moose, and even sharks if neseseary.

Habitat

A Orca lives in the Picific, Antartic, and Artic oceans. They meet up in packs and migrate together. From pole to pole every year.

Orcas in Captivity

You can even see Orcas just in the wild… but in captivity too! Sea World has orginized a program where Orcas “preform” with stunt divers that do tricks on them and the Orcas do tricks themselves! The Orcas are not bothered by this, some even like it!

Fun Facts

Here are some facts you might not know about Orca Whales.
1. An Orca is a type of dolphin
2. The Scientific name for a Orca is Orcinus orca
3. Orcas can even be completley white which is super rare!

Conclusion

Orca whales are truly astonishing beautiful animals. I encourage you to go to Sea World in San Diego CA and see them in captivity! Or go whale watching and see them in the wild. Like I said Orcas are truly astonishing beautiful animals.
