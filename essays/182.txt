Atoms
By Jamie

Did you know that an atom consists of three parts electrons, protons, and neutrons? Electrons are tiny and protons and neutrons are twice the size. And protons and neutrons are in the nucleus.

First, electrons are very tiny in fact they are the second smallest thing we have discovered. Also they move nearly at the speed of light. They also have a negative charge. Also don’t contain quarks. 

Glossary (simplified)

Quark /kwärk/ n / a part of a part of an atom.
Atom /adem/ n / an extremely small amount of a thing or quality
Electron /e’lek,trän/ n/ a stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids.
