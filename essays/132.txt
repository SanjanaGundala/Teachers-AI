The Legend of Zelda: A Link between worlds.

Have you ever Played the Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds? I have beat it. It was fun and now I will give you some tips on how to beat it your self!

Bosses (there are so many of these I dont have time to write them)

My PersonaLL favroite boss is Stalbind a huge Devil that hits you with its sword and dark fire. most bosses need to be beat with a certain Itim Like for exampal margomill needs a tornado rod and bombs to be beat. Or Like Knuklemaster you need bombs or a hamer.

Items (lots of these too)

In this game Pretty early into it rivaro opens a Iteim shop in your house and all Items can be bought or rented. Rented Itims work the same as they do when you buy them Later on.

Characters

There are not so many characters but Lots of secondary characters. Riviro is a merchan in a purple Robe and a bunny mask. yuga is a evile sorcarer that is trying to bring back ganon.  Zelda is the princes and (later) Queen. hilda is the revers worlds Zelda. And finaly Link is your main character.

Lots of Zelda games have came out but this one is one of the best so I encorage you to try and beat it. many have and many havent and If you havent then I encourage you to try the game.
