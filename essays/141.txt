Most people wear soccer shorts because they play soccer and the soccer shorts are what the refs prefer. Your coach will have the balls. If you want you can use football gloves but you canâ€™t use baseball gloves. You will also need a mouthguard. You can buy mouthguards at Target, Dicks, and Big 5. You can also get a case for your mouthguard.
 
Rules
        	There can only be six players on the field playing at a time. The quarterback, hiker and four other players. When you are on defence the person who is going to rush needs to be behind the marker. If you are 10 or less yards away from the endzone you can not run the ball. It has to be a pass.
