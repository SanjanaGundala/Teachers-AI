Dear Friend,
Have you ever wondered the parts of a saddle, or maybe what the Heck is the thing in the riders armpit (a crop)? If you have you’ll find out the answer in Oh, abot 5 seconds.

PARTS OF A SADDLE

A saddle has quite a few parts, but some of the easiest/simplest parts are: the horn, the seat, the stirrups, the gurth. There are also some helpful things like a halter & riens. These things each have a use. ex.
The seat = To sit on, obviously
The horn = I use it to hold onto sometimes
the stirrup = for your feet so you have a better grip on your horse
the gurth = to hold the saddle on your horse
The riens = to control your horse
The halter = to connect your lead rope & riens to.

Tools
In horse back riding there are some tools that help. For example a crop which is a stick about two feet long with a piece of leather on the bottom which you hit the horse in the butt with to get it to go faster or listen to you. There is also a whip, which is basically the same as a crop. A whip is a stick with a long piece of rope on the bottom that you “Crack the whip” with. If your wondering where the heck the expression crack the whip came from its because when you swing the whip at the ground it sounds like someones cracking a piece of wood.

I hope you learned some new facts or information. P.S. If you enjoyed this book/essay I encourage you to try out horseback riding, it’s super fun!

Sighned,
your friend
