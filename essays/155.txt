They also eat clover, basil, bok choy, broccoli, carrot tops, celery, collard greens, and hay.

What they need
Rabbits need a lot of things like they need water to keep them hydrated and they need food to keep them healthy and a sleter to keep them safe. Why rabbits need these things is because it’s how you take care of a rabbit and that’s how you would take care of any other pet’s.
