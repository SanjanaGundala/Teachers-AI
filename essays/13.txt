	First of all rules are very important in soccer. Here some rules that are in soccer, you can header the ball some seasons or you can drop kick the ball something. When your playing you can't hit the ball out of bounds or the other team gets to throw the ball in. Another rule is no hands only feet.

Positions
	To continure, here are the positions.  There are many positions like goalie or defence, there is one person in the goal and three people playing defence.  Two other positions are midfield or forward, there is two to three people playing mid field and three playing forward.

PLaying the real game!
	To move on, here's how to play with rules and positions.  The people playing forward kick the ball back to the midfielders and move up the fiels and defence falls back if the other team gets the ball and run torward the goal.  And if the goalie catches it and throws or jacks it up the field then the forwards or midfielders go make a goal and if they make it they get a point and the team with the most points win.  After the practive games there's playoffs.
