Do you know that one day I was playing outside with my tow sisters and my tow causins and the door was opend and my dog ran out and I tod my causins and siters to corner my dog and then I cout him? In my opinion I believe that I should have a pet of my own because I am old enough, My parents wount have to buy the stuff for the pet, I think I am very responsibel. 

First I should have a pet of my own because I am matror enough, there’s a boy in my class that has his own dog he feeds them, lets them out, and pick’s up there pop, and I think that’s mutrer and responsibel to have my own pet. 

Second I should have a pet of my own because I wount make my parent’s buy the stuff for the Pet, they wount have to buy the bed or the food, and also they wount have to buy the caler or the lash. 

Fanily I should have a pet of my own because I am very responsibel. When we got miko I have him his food and water, I played with him when my mom coudin’t, and I took him to go to the bathroom, I think that’s responsibel enough to have my own pet. 

I think I am mutre enough and my parent’s wount have to buy the stuff for the pet also I am very responsibel to have my own pet.
