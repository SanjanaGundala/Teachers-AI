In this information writing am going to tell you about soccer. And the rules and the game also penalties. And how you get free kicks in a soccer game.

Chapter 1
The game

Have you ever wondered how a soccer game works. i will tell you for an example. in a game there are types of games like a final a final is the same thing like a regular game but you get a trophy if you win a final. In a match you play with 11 players and try to win a game.

Chapter 2
The rules

Do you know the rules of the game. if you don’t know i could teach you. The first rule is to have 11 players on the field. And to not handball if you don’t no it’s when you touch the ball in the box but when it’s a throw in you can touch it. And goalkeeper is the only won that touches it with in the box. And you can’t make fecal contact with players. Or you can get a red or a yellow card that means you sit out for three matches. Fact Cristiano ronaldo had to sit out three matches in juventus and it was his 2 match in juventus.

Chapter 3
Penalties

A way to get a penalty is if you for an example is. When you hand a ball in the keepers box that means. Your opponent gets a shot on target to score. And another way to give your opponent a penalty is by slide tackling in the goal box that means a red or a yellow.

Chapter 4
Free kicks

A way to get a free kick is. if your enemy tries to tackle you outside of the goal box that’s a free kick for your team. And if you slide some won you get your enemy a free kick. And free kicks are really dangerous when you are losing a game.

That’s why i think people should like soccer because it is fun. To play and do because you can learn and exercise.
