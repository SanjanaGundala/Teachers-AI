Gaming PC
CYBERPOWERPC i think that you should buy this gaming PC because it has intel core, AMD FX 6300 processor, and lots and lots of other things that will make you look like a gamer and your gaming setup look like a true gaming setup this gaming setup runs like a real gaming setup.  Also it is accessible for VR such as vive VR and Oculus VR. also this gaming PC doesn't just run good it also looks how a gaming PC should look like. my favorite thing is that instead of plastic on the one side of the PC its glass so you can see the inside of the PC. also in the inside of the PC there are LED gaming lights. and that's why i think you should buy the CYBERPOWERPC
