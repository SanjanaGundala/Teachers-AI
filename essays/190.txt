Giraffes
Giraffes are amazing animals did you know that giraffes can hold 12 gallons of air in their lungs and if you stick around you will learn more cool facts.
I think that giraffes are amazing because they are very tall, they have a big heart, and most of all because they are all different in some way just like people.

Height
One reason that Giraffes are amazing animals is that they are the tallest living land animals. For example according to google just a giraffes legs are taller than many humans-about 6 feet. Also, according to google when a baby giraffe is born it stands at 6 ft. tall and after 10 hours it will be running with the other Giraffes! And lastly on Google it says that a northern giraffe average height is 15-20 ft. tall.

Big Heart
Another reason that Giraffes are amazing is that they have a big heart. One example is according to google and it says that a Giraffe has a big heart because of its long neck, because they spend a lot of time moving their heads down low top high so they need a way to keep the blood flowing to the brain so they don't get light headed. Also on Google I learned that “scientists once thought that vessels in the giraffe's neck siphoned blood from the heart to the brain”. And lastly Giraffes have a big heart because they are kind and gentle animals and don't bother attacking if they aren't threatened.

Different
Although Giraffes are amazing because they are the tallest land animals and because they have a big heart they are all different just like people.

Conclusion
In conclusion Giraffes are amazing because they are the tallest living land animals and they have a big heart and most of all because they are all different from each other just like people i hope that you think giraffes are amazing too.
