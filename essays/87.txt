Hawaii
Introduction 
Have you ever been to Hawaii? Well neither have I. If you do go to visit Hawaii I recommend you to go visit the island. The first reason why to visit the island is because you can go swimming with the animals like sea turtles, fish,and MUCH MORE!!! The second place I recommend you to visit is their food so you can try something new. The last place I recommend you to visit is maybe their shops so you can buy something and keep a memory of when you visited Hawaii like necklaces, bracelets, key chains, shirts, and accessories
