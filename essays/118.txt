Rugby
 
Did you know that there are over 30 players on the field at once in one game! Rugby is a great sport because of all the positions, all of the defensive plays and most of all, because of the tackling.
 
One reason that rugby is a great sport is because of all the positions. One reason is that, according to ruck.co.uk there are 15 players one side at once. Secondly, some of the positions are hocker, prop, and left wing and these are all part of a scrum. Lastly, all positions help the team and some of the most important ones are scrum half because he/she puts the all in during the scrum another is prop the prop sets up the scrum.
 
Another reason that rugby is a great sport is because of the defensive plays. One reasonable thing to do is, to tackle the player you have to put your shoulder down and go under the waist. To add on,according to rugby coach weekly you could miss pass in a scrum. One last thing is, there is a pressure winder. What happens is you hold the position with dummy runners to move their winger to defence line.
 
Although rugby is a great sport because of all the positions and because of the defensive plays especially rugby is a great sport because of the tackling. Firstly, according to rugby how you can only tackle the ball carrier. The again, you can only talk in the play of field. The last thing, the ball carrier must be being held or the bell carter is not tackled.
 
In conclusion rugby is a great sport because of all the positions, because of the defensive plays, and most of all, because of the tackling. I think ruby is an amazing sport and you should play at any chance you can. And one last thing, do you think you could wright and play rugby?
