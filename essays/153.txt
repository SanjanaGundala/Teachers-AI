Different bikes
Do you have a mountain bike? Well I do of course mountain bikes can be fun just bombing hill they can also be fun by going of jumps and wooden features. There are two types of mountain bikes, hardtail and downhill bikes. Hardtail are really sturdy but are very heavy compared to downhill bikes which aren’t very sturdy but have amazing shocks.

Hardest trail
Did you know that Robbie Maddison (a pro mountain biker) went of a 1875 ft drop on a mountain bike. The hardest public mountain bike park is moab, Utoh. Moab has technical turns, hard climbs and big jumps.

RED BULL RAMPAGE
Fun fact: read red bull rampage has been around for 18 years. There 18 riders that participate in the red bull rampage. THe rules: before the event each rider will design there trail and have a team go out onto mountain and create the trail. The riders will then will have three turns and the only run that counts is the one that you get the most points you earn points by having soft and smooth landing and cool tricks.

Conclusion
Fun fact: “One of the first known models of a mountain bike was back in 1896, where bicycles were modified for “off-road” use by Buffalo Soldier from Montana to Yellowstone in the United States.” https://interestingfacts.tv .
