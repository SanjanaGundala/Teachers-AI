Asthma
 
Did you know that asthma is a disease? Asthma is a big issue. It is a big issue because there is asthma attacks, there’s special treatments, and most of all, because my family and friends have asthma.
 
One reason asthma is a big issue is that there is asthma attacks. For example, when it starts your airwaves get narrower and it gets hard to breath. You usually have to go to the hospital and get a oxygen mask to get air in your lounges. To add on, the disease will happen when you are being to active, idt hurts your lounges and leaves you without breath.
 
Another reason is, there is special treatments. My evidence for this is, you need to use and inhaler which puffs salbutamol which is a medication that helps you control your breathing and gives you oxygen so you can breath. Also, you can’t be active with sports or you just have to use the inhaler 30 minutes before in the middle and at 30 minutes after. Also, basketball, soccer, and sports that have a lot of running are not a good choice.
 
Although asthma is a big issue because there are asthma attacks, the treatments, especially because, my family and friends have asthma. My first example is, my cousin has bronchitis and her asthma makes it even worse. Also, my friend plays softball and she uses an inhaler 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after. And she has to play catcher because it doesn’t have a lot of running like outfield and other positions. In conclusion, asthma is a big issue because of the asthma attacks, the treatments, and most of all because, my family and friends have asthma. I think doctors should find a way to get rid of asthma. What will you do to help?
