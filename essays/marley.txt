“Get ready for soccer practice we got to leave in 10 mins!” yelled dad. ”I’m almost ready I just need to put on my cleats!” I yelled! “Were almost there just gonna take another 15-20 mins because of traffic!” said my dad. When we got there I went to go say i’m here to my coach. “Hey Mar” exclaimed my coach. “Hey coach sorry i’m late there was traffic on the way over here” I responded.

When there was 30 mins left my coach told us we were gonna do a scrimmage “Were all here so there will be a equal amount 7v7” answered my coach. about half way of the scrimmage thru the ball was in the middle of the field me and my teammate Bruce went for the ball. 

“I got it!” I yelled “I got it!” yelled bruce we said at the same time we both tried to kick it.
