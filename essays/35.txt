Did you know that shih tzus originate from China? (And by the way a shih tzu is a type of dog if you didn’t already know that). Shih tzus are animals that you can talk to and think of as a friend. Today I’ll be telling you about what shih tzus eat, and how they act, and what you need to take care of them. 

Most shih tzus eat grain free food. Sometimes you make your dog food for example, turkey, chicken, and sliced up carrots. When you buy your dog food you can test some out to see if they like the food. Shih tzu’s are very picky dogs and they take a while to find the right food for them. If you have two shih tzu’s most often they like different things so you might have to test out a few different food for them. They like vegetables. (They can’t have fruit because of the seeds). Well now you know what they like to eat.

Shih tzus are very active and like to play a lot. But rarely they like to sleep because they’re too busy playing. But when they do sleep they like to snuggle but in the morning they go right back to being mischievous and playful. For example sometimes they will take things and destroy them (latter you will forgive them… someday). But they’re also very loving dogs. If you don’t play with them they will get a little mad and start to bark but they are very sweet most of the time. Shih tzus are also very smart. But shih tzu’s also think they are the king/queen of the world so they can’t be that smart.

Frist what you need to take care of a shih tzu is food, water, a leash, a dog bed, and you have to be very patient. You also have to be willing to play all the time. And go for walks all the time. Also you need to have a lot of free time or have kids so that they can play with the dog because shih tzus have a lot of energy.

Now you know you are an expert on what shih tzus eat, how they act, and what you need to take care of them. So that makes seans you learn something everyday and this is a great example for that.
