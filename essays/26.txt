Have you ever realised that Mrs. Vega’s class bareley gets any time on computers a week? Well I have a solution. Thats why I believe we should have one hour of computers a week because we only get thirty minutes a week, we should get todo other things than ST Math, Most of all we should have time to change backrounds. 

To get it started with we should have more computer time because we only set 30 minutes a week. For example we only get 30 minutes on ST Math and nothing else. 

Another reason we should be able to do other things then ST Math. Because reasearch has shown that it’s not good to do just one thing. 

Last but not least we should have one hour on the computer is because we never get time to change backrounds. For example we have only gotten to change backrounds two times.

In conclusion I realise it’s good to have a little bit of computer time bbut it’s better to have an hour because we only get 30 minutes a week, we should be able to do other things not just ST Math, and most of all we should have time to change backrounds.
