Introduction 
I am writing about Twist Ties because I think there cool. Twist Ties are made of metal wires and papery plastic. You can find them usually at grocery stars there free for the taking. 

Things you can make 
You can make anything you want with Twist Ties. For example you could make a tiny dog. For another example you could even make a life sized dog! The last thing i’ll tell you is very important to make good stuff with them you have to be good with legos!

Things You Can Make With Them 
You can use Twist Ties to close your bread. You could also make things with them like I do. Or you could find a new way to use them!
