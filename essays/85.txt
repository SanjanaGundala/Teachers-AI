Roblox
	There are so many Video Games in the entire world. But I am here to only teach you about one. And its Roblox. lastly, you will learn about the games in Roblox. Come with me and learn all about Roblox!

	I will now teach you about the money in Roblox. The money in Roblox is called Robux. You can use it to buy outfits, gear, avatars, animation's, and new faces and hair styles. You can also buy money in a game with Robux. you can upgrade your house with Robux. You can also donate robux to a friend. The bad thing about Robux is that you have to pay money in real life to get Robux. You have to pay $5 for 400 Robux, and $10 for 800 Robux. Robux is a really clever name.

	Now I will teach you about the friends in Roblox. To get a friend in Roblox is really easy. All you have to do is at the bottom of the screen you click on friends and you can search up any person in the game. It can be your best friend or someone famous that plays the game and then you click the send friend request and you wait maybe a few days and they might of accepted it. You can join your friends while there playing a game. You can make new friends in the game or they can be your best friend.

	Now, lastly I will teach you about the games in Roblox. What I mostly like about Roblox is the games there is SO MANY games. in Roblox there is billions of games in the game. They are all made by other players. That's also what I like is that there made by you. Its so fun because you can spend Robux in a game and you can play with a friend. Here is some examples for games: Jailbreak, Bloxburg, Doomspire Brickbattle, Work At A Pizza Place, and run hide escape. There are a lot of games! :)
