How to Heely
	I’m going to teach you how to Heely. Heelys are shoes that have wheels on the bottom of them. There’s three easy steps to Heely, first you have to have the correct gear then you have to be in the correct area. Lastly and most important you have to know how to do it.

What to wear to Heely
	First you have to have the correct gear you want to have socks that cover your ankles not no show socks then they’ll give you a blister and that will hurt then you will need elbow pads and knee pads so if you fall you won’t get hurt. If your a beginner I recommend you wear pants so if you fall you still won’t hurt yourself even if your wearing knee pads you could still hurt yourself.
Where to be to Heely
	Second of all you need to be in the right area a great place for me is in the kitchen because the floor in smooth because it’s wood when you Heely you don’t want to be on tile because the tile has cracks and that’s how you will fall smooth wood is a great place to Heely also don’t Heely on gravel because gravel is bumpy and that’s the easiest way to fall.

How to Heely
	Third of all you want to know how to do it it’s the most important step so first to get the hang of it you want to put your weaker foot out on the heel and push off from something. For example I used a chair and pushed off to the couch and I did that over and over intel I got good at it another way to do it is have someone hold you hands well you push off and then practice that over and over again it really helps the more you do it the better you get at it.

In conclusion you have learned a little bit about the tree easy steps to do it the first step was what you need in order to Heely somethings were socks and knee pads then  the second step was you have to be in the right area and the third step was the most important step which was how to Heely.
