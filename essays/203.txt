Narwhals

Did you know that the scientific name for a Narwhal is “Monodon Monoceros”? If you want to learn more about Narwhals, then read on. In this essay you will learn about Narwhals habitats, their Diet\Predators, and threats that could make Narwhals Extinct.

My first subtopic is about Narwhal habitats. Narwhals usually go threw the cycle of going to Canada to Greenland to Eastern Russia. Primarily, Narwhals stay in the Atlantic ocean (In the Arctic). Narwhals usually spend two months in Arctic ice-free fjords and bays and migrate to overwinter offshore in deep ice-covered habitats.

My second subtopic is about the diets\predators of the Narwhal. Narwhals have only two teeth, both in the upper jaw. The left tooth in the upper jaw continues to grow and become a tusk. Tusks are believed to play a part in the breeding competition. Narwhals make deep dives to feed near the bottom, likely using suction to swallow their prey whole. Narwhals eat fish, shrimp, and squid. Narwhal predators are Killer Whales and Polar Bears.

Lastly, my third subtopic is about the threats to Narwhals. Narwhals are threatened by hunting. For example, people hunt Narwhals for their ivory. Narwhals are also threatened from climate change. For example, the climate is getting a little bit warmer in the arctic places. Lastly, Narwhals are threatened from industrial activities. For example, some factories that have gas coming out of the top, even though they are thousands of miles apart, the gas could get into the air of a Narwhal and kill it.

All in all, you have learned a lot about Narwhals. You have learned about the habitats of a Narwhal, the diet\predators of a Narwhal, and the threats of a Narwhal. I hope that you will research more about Narwhals and become an expert.
