One Sunny afternoon my brother and I Were jumping on the trampoline and my brother acsedently thrugh the ball over the fence and it landed in our naborgs yard. So me and my brother got out and told my mom where we were going and started walking over (the house was behined our house so we had to walk down a hill on the street.)

I started walking down the hill, my brother was on his skatebord, and he called out: “Get out of the way!” So I did but unfohently he was going that way!

CRASH! He crashed in to me and I hit my head on a car and skinned my nee. My brother pulled me on to my feet and we started to walk back home I was soooo mad at my brother that I did not say a word. (I talk alot so that is unlikely for me.)

When we got home my mom took me into the bathroom and washed my nee off and got me an bandaid. My mom asked what happend and I explaind. Now my brother knows to tell what derection to go! 

I will never forget that day!
