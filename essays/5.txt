In this page you  will gonna learn about danceeeeeeeeeeeees! On fortnite there is a lot of dance one of them was floss, hype even orange justice three of those was some of the rare emote. You will be asking why did I just put three emotes”? I put three emotes because If I write a lot there were no space to write. And I want you to learn more about dances. Ok no more dramas let go back to the learning part. On fortnite some player was doing emotes when they got Victory royals. And some of them was doing emotes when they kill someone.
