Different types of Bikes

Have you ever thought about how many different bikes there are? Well today I am going to show you all the bikes that I know about.For my first reason I am going to be talking about different types of bikes. The first bike I am going to be talking about is a Mountain bike. One of the really good reasons you should use a mountain bike is they go on mountains and do tricks. Also they have really grippy tires. The next bike I am going to be talking about is BMX bikes. One really good reason about this bike is it can do many tricks like a Fable Grind. The last bike I am going to be talking about is an Electric bike. One really good reason about the electric bike is it can move by itself if you spin the bars. Also if you pedal you give the electric motor energy.

Gear

Have  you ever wondered what you need to be safe well I will tell you right now! The first thing that you need is a helmet. The helmet is the best thing you can have because it protects your head. The last thing is pads. The bads are special cause they protect your knees, elbows, and feet.
