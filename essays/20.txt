I believe that we should have a 20 min Recess because students need more exesise. Its Healthy for you also when you run your legs get stronger and run faster. Another reason is when you eat all of your food you only have 3-5 min to play i take my food when im playing. My third reason is i think we should have 5 min to eat and 15 min to play. Students will get more focus during class if we have 10 min recess students will get lazy some students sleep when during reading. Also if we had a 10 min recess students there gonna have energy.
