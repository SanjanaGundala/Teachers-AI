Designer Clothes
Introduction

Look at the line at Supreme and Bape mom, it’s pretty big. Hello, today I will be telling you about some of the most $$$ and cool looking designer clothes in the word and the brands are Bape, Supreme and bape collab hope you enjoy and learn some stuff.

Bape

Bape is a big company that a lot of people are wearing these days and it goes for a pretty high price and I actually have a couple of these clothes and my sweatshirt that I have of theirs was 450$ and I will pull up a photo at the end of these paragraphs but what bape really is, is a designer company and it is lot’s of money and they do some collabs with other $$$ companies and the colors are mainly green, purple and blue for a lot of their clothes but now we have to move on to the other brands.

Bape and Supreme collabs

Bape and Supreme did a big collab and they made a lot of money by a couple of shirts, shoes and sweatshirts and I will pull up a photo of their collabs but the colors are usually camo and red black and yeah look at what it really looks like down here. The reasons why they do collabs is because both companies want money and people both like supreme and bape so then they have a little of both. A collab is when two companies get together and make the ultimate piece of clothing like these two down here.

Supreme

Now for the last slide it is about supreme itself and they have made lots of money in the past few years and the creator of supreme is James Jebbia and he founded the company in 1994 and that’s why in some of their shirts have the number 94 on them.

Conclusion

Good bye, I hope you learned a lot about these two companies and the collabs I hope you can go and some of their clothes they look really cool and you will not regret your purchase at all. Hoped you liked it, oh and don’t tell you mom or dad that I wanted you to buy this stuff, it’s a lot of money$$$.
