Magic the gathering

Did you know that magic the gathering has been out for 25 years. Magic the gathering is interesting because there are collectables, types of cards, and lastly the game rules.

One reason magic the gathering is interesting is there are collectables. (mtg wiki says) My first evidence is that you can get lots of new cards to build new and better and better decks. Also, when you opening a booster pack (get booster packs get 15 new cards) you have no idea what your gonna get! You could get a legendary card, more on that later. Lastly because when your making a new deck the cards from a booster pack could help you make lots of decks or one. These cards can help you win a game! you can also buy cards online-

Another reason magic is interesting is because is the types of cards. Famdom said that (my first evidence is) there is 13 different types of cards in magic. Also all the cards in the game are sorted by sliver, black, legendary, and mythic legendary. legendary color is gold mythic is bright orange lastly the cards have different abilities that at the right time it could make you win.

Although magic the gathering is interesting because the collectables, also the types of cards, most of all the game rules. First because some cards you can only use one time during your turn, and some you can only use one time in the game! Also some cards that have abilities that can help you win, for example trample, if a creature has trample if a creature blocks it, it will take damage to the player your playing.

In conclusion Magic is interesting because collectibles types of cards and most of all the game rules. I think that everyone could have fun to play this game. Will the cards go your way?
