Dogs

Hey there kids, say are you ready to learn about Dogs? Did you know that Dogs don’t always get along when you want them to so get them as a puppy so you can get a trainer. Plus you get some free time to yourself!

Dogs are loyal and good hunters.  Some love water, some don’t.  I know for a fact they love food and water.  You should give lots of love to your dog and he or she will do the same for you.  You can train your dog to find people’s belongings and other things.  Dogs have teeth to rip meat of bones, nose to smell the scent of a dog for over a mile away wow, they have great ears for hearing, and they have great eyesight. Dogs go way back in history like before romans ruled. Dogs I think came from wolves. Some people’s stories say that foxes come from the dog family, but they come from the cat family. You should give your dog training if there is a break in and when the burglars break in … GRRRR!  Your dog will go caching the burglars. If your dog is not going to catch the burglars, you might hear a gunshot. Also you should feed and walk your dog every day. you do one cup of food soft or hard.

When you dog is sick you should take it to the vet for a check up to see what your dog might have. You might need to wait outside of the office while your dog is getting a check up. They might give your dog a treat or two if you are ok with it.  If your does bites you will have to put a muzzle on your dog’s nose to keep your dog from biting the vet.

That is why i wanted to teach you about dogs. Thank you for reading my book. Dogs #2 is going to be out may! Thank you again for reading. Please remember me.
