Cats Are Good Landers
	Did you know that cats are amazing at landing? Well they are! They can fall off of high buildings without getting hurt, they have great righting reflexes, and most of all cats gave very strong feet.
	
	One reason cats are great at landing is cats can fall 5.5 stories and 32 stories high without getting hurt! But also cats can climb walls. Their claws help them climb. When they are ready to get off a wall, they jump off and sometimes land on their feet.

	Another reason cats are good landers is cats have good righting reflexes. Like I told you cats can climb walls. Here’s how they get off the wall they climb the wall, then they jump, twist and spread their feet. Lastly, like I told you the SOMETIMES land on their feet. But cats can also climb around corners, their claws help them climb really well!

	Although cats have really strong feet, the feet help them get away, climb, land, and more! Cats don’t mean to get hurt when they fall off something, they think their going to land on their feet, but sometimes they don’t make it. When the fail to and on their feet, they get hurt really bad, especially when they fall off of HIGH buildings. I mean cats are good landers… but not all the time… sometimes when they fall off of really high buildings, they sometimes die because their feet are broken or because of something else. And no one likes dying animals or pets or whatever.

	In conclusion, cats are great at landing but sometimes NOPE. But most of the time cats are GREAT landers and they SOMETIMES make it ALL the time. Cats can be also great climbers like I said they have strong feet, and they can climb walls!
